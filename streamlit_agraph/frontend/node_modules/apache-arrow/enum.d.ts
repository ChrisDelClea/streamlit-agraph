/**
 * Main data type enumeration.
 *
 * Data types in this library are all *logical*. They can be expressed as
 * either a primitive physical type (bytes or bits of some fixed size), a
 * nested type consisting of other data types, or another data type (e.g. a
 * timestamp encoded as an int64).
 *
 * **Note**: Only enum values 0-17 (NONE through Map) are written to an Arrow
 * IPC payload.
 *
 * The rest of the values are specified here so TypeScript can narrow the type
 * signatures further beyond the base Arrow Types. The Arrow DataTypes include
 * metadata like `bitWidth` that impact the type signatures of the values we
 * accept and return.
 *
 * For example, the `Int8Vector` reads 1-byte numbers from an `Int8Array`, an
 * `Int32Vector` reads a 4-byte number from an `Int32Array`, and an `Int64Vector`
 * reads a pair of 4-byte lo, hi 32-bit integers as a zero-copy slice from the
 * underlying `Int32Array`.
 *
 * Library consumers benefit by knowing the narrowest type, since we can ensure
 * the types across all public methods are propagated, and never bail to `any`.
 * These values are _never_ used at runtime, and they will _never_ be written
 * to the flatbuffers metadata of serialized Arrow IPC payloads.
